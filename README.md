# AE-502-Homework-Project-2-

the codes are based on the ch 12 from Curtis book and Appendix D

The code named "Example_12.6" validates the Gauss variational/planetary equations
by plotting them over a time of 2days.

The code named "Gauss_variational_eqns" plots the Gauss variation equations for
hw/proj 2 question 3 for a Molniya orbit: a = 26600km, i = 1.10654rad, e = 0.74, 
ω = 5deg ,Ω = 90deg, M0 = 10deg for 100 days. 

the code named "Bonus_problem" is the code I tried to write that plots the a,i,e,w, & Ω
by deriving the Gauss planetary equations for the equinoctial elements by folloing the 
derivation in Battin book. For the code I used the same method that was used for the other
two codes. But unfortunately it gives empty plots.
